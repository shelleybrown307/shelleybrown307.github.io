This is my Code Louisville Project. It introduces my GPS Squad book series. Additionally, it introduces me as the author, my GPS Squad characters and the GPS Store items for sale. 
The first radio button when clicked will display the second GPS Squad book. The other two radio buttons do not display a book cover because they are coming soon. I have included my book video trailer below.
